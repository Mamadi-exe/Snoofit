# 🦅 SnooFit: Snoonu Gamified Discovery

> A location-based "Move-to-Earn" experience built for Snoonu to drive user engagement through physical exploration.

---

## 📖 Overview

**SnooFit** is a gamified web application built with **React, TypeScript, and Vite**. Inspired by mechanics like *Pokémon GO*, it encourages Snoonu users to walk to specific "Capture Zones" in the real world to collect points.

Users navigate a live map, and once they are within the designated radius of a point, they can "capture" it. These points are added to their profile and can be redeemed for exclusive Snoonu rewards, coupons, and discounts.

### ✨ Key Features

* **📍 Real-time Geolocation:** Tracks user movement live using the browser's Geolocation API.
* **🎯 Proximity-Based Capturing:** Points only become "capturable" when the user is within a specific distance (e.g., 20 meters).
* **🏆 Global Leaderboard:** Ranks users based on total points captured to encourage competition.
* **🎁 Reward Store:** A dedicated section to exchange points for Snoonu vouchers.
* **📱 Mobile-First Design:** Optimized for on-the-go usage with a sleek, responsive UI.
